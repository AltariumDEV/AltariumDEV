# Altarium (AltariasMainAccount)

Good day to you, reader. My name is Altarium (Altar or Alty for short). 
<br>I am a software developer with decent experience in JavaScript (PureJS, NodeJS and TypeScript), Lua, Java and C#.
<br>I started software development 5 years ago and have been steadily improving.

Here are some fancy stats that are made using anuraghazra's readme stats repo (Please do note that these stats are based on public repositories, not private ones):

I hope you have a fantastic morning/day/evening/night.
